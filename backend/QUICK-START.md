## üîß Troubleshooting

### If seed fails:

The seed script only runs once. To re-seed:

1. Delete the `.tmp/data.db` file
2. Restart Strapi: `pnpm develop`
3. Run seed again: `pnpm seed`

### To reset everything:

```bash
# Stop Strapi (Ctrl+C)
rm -rf .tmp/data.db
pnpm develop
# Create admin account again
pnpm seed
```

## üåê Building a Frontend

This is a **headless CMS** - you need a separate frontend to display the website.

### Recommended Stack:

- **Next.js** (React framework with SSR/SSG)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling like the inspiration site)
- **React Hook Form** (for contact form)

### Frontend Setup (example with Next.js):

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest kim-vassallo-frontend
cd kim-vassallo-frontend
npm install axios
```

### Fetch Data Example:

```javascript
// In your Next.js pages/components
const res = await fetch('http://localhost:1337/api/home')
const { data } = await res.json()
console.log(data) // { name: "Kim Vassallo", ... }
```
